The context provided says that \"Sujeet is a senior software engineer at Kaplan.\" \\n\\nAlright, let me break this down. First, the name \"Sujeet\" isn\\'t something familiar to me immediately. It sounds like it could be of Indian origin since I know names like Anil or Rajesh are common there. But maybe that\\'s irrelevant here.\\n\\nThe key part is \"senior software engineer.\" So, if someone says that Sujeet is a senior software engineer at Kaplan, then his job title should definitely be \"Senior Software Engineer.\" \\n\\nWait, could there be any other titles he might have? Maybe like a lead developer or principal engineer? But the context specifically mentions \"senior software engineer,\" so it\\'s best to stick with that. \\n\\nI\\'m also thinking about whether \"Kaplan\" refers to the company name. Kaplan is an educational testing service, but they probably employ software engineers as part of their IT team. So, Sujeet\\'s role would be within that department.\\n\\nIs there any chance of confusion between different job titles? For example, sometimes people might use terms like \"lead engineer\" or \"senior developer,\" but in this case, it\\'s clearly stated as a senior software engineer. \\n\\nI should also consider if \"Kaplan\" is the company name, and that\\'s where Sujeet works, so his title doesn\\'t change just because he\\'s at Kaplan. He remains a senior software engineer.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, based on the context provided, Sujeet\\'s job title is Senior Software Engineer.\\n</think>\\n\\nSujeet\\'s job title is Senior Software Engineer.', 'model': 'DeepSeek-R1', 'provider': 'Ollama'}\n"
